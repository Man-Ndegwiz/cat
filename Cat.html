	<p>Starting with the show-stopper, Ford released the Mustang Bullitt. It was highly rumored that this vehicle would greet visitors at this year's Detroit Auto Show. You might remember the Bullitt from the 1969 Steve McQueen movie, which featured a 1968 Ford Mustang.

In fact, McQueen's granddaughter Molly McQueen was the one on stage Sunday night who introduced the new pony car. While the automaker did not immediately make the specs of the Bullitt available, McQueen did say it would be more powerful than a Ford Mustang GT. It will feature more than 475 horsepower when the limited-edition muscle car is released this summer.</p>

	<p>Ford kept the heat on rivals at the show.

TheStreet got a close look at the four-door, orange Ford Ranger as it rolled onto the stage following. To be sure, the new Ranger looked far more epic than the previous generation that was discontinued in 2011. The automaker said they wanted a blend of capability and fuel efficiency. The fact it looks cool probably doesn't hurt, either.

The Ranger will be available at dealerships in the first quarter of 2019. Ford says the Ranger has continued to sell strongly overseas, offering up hope its return to the U.S. will be well-received.</p>

	<p>Nobody needs to be a super-sleuth these days to guess the direction a motor manufacturer is going to be going in over the next few years. If it doesn't have an SUV in its lineup it soon will have, and no matter what type of automaker it is, electrification is also going to figure in future plans. Lamborghini has already gone down the SUV route with the stunning Urus, and it appears hybridization is next on the Italian supercar manufacturer's list of things to do, possibly with a future version of the legendary Aventador.

Speaking to Motor Authority at the Detroit Auto Show last week, Lamborghini's head of research and development, Maurizio Reggiani, said "we must decide what will be the future of the super sports car in terms of electric contribution."</p>
